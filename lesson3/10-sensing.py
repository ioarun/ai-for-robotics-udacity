# --------------
# USER INSTRUCTIONS
#
# Write a function in the class robot called sense()
# that takes self as input
# and returns a list, Z, of the four bearings* to the 4
# different landmarks. you will have to use the robot's
# x and y position, as well as its orientation, to
# compute this.
#
# *bearing is defined in the video
# which accompanies this problem.
#
# For now, please do NOT add noise to your sense function.
#
# Please do not modify anything except where indicated
# below.
#
# There are test cases provided at the bottom which you are
# free to use. If you uncomment any of these cases for testing
# make sure that you re-comment it before you submit.

# in the traditional (x, y) format!
