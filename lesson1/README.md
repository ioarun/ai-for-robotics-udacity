## Lesson 1 : Localization

In this lesson, we learnt about-
* Markov Localization
* Probabilities
* Bayes Rule
* Total Probability
* Histogram Filters
* We wrote a sense and move program in which sense involves BAYES THEOREM (product) and 
  move involves TOTAL PROBABILITY (convolution).
* Finally we wrote a program on localization
