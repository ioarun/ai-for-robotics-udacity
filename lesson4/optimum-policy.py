# ----------
# User Instructions:
# 
# Write a function optimum_policy that returns
# a grid which shows the optimum policy for robot
# motion. This means there should be an optimum
# direction associated with each navigable cell from
# which the goal can be reached.
# 
# Unnavigable cells as well as cells from which 
# the goal cannot be reached should have a string 
# containing a single space (' '), as shown in the 
# previous video. The goal cell should have '*'.
